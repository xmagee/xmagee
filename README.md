I am a software developer with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems and Technology from the University of Pittsburgh; 3.2 GPA. I have experience in  developing rich web experiences one year as an intern, and nearly two years working self-employed. 
  
My skillset includes database config/development, backend development and testing, and frontend design and implementation. My most recent professional work has been focused on backend development of REST webapi's and internal tools utilizing the dotnet ecosystem.

  Currently happily employed as Software Developer I at Seneca Resources, LLC.

Feel free to look around at my mostly-unfinished projects, and maybe steal some code to use later :)
