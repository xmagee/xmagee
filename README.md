I am a software developer with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems and Technology from the University of Pittsburgh; 3.2 GPA. I have experience developing rich web experiences one year as an intern, and nearly two years working self-employed. Currently happily employed as a Software Developer at Seneca Resources, LLC.

Feel free to look around at my mostly-unfinished projects, and steal some code to reuse later :)
